# pickle-linux

The Pickle Linux repositories.

## `main`

This is the repository holding all the essential packages needed for the distribution to function correctly.
There isn't any dependency specified in those packages as they're all installed together in the system image.

## `user`

This is the repository for all optional packages that can be layered on top of the system image.
